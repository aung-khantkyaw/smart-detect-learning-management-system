    This course introduces the principles and techniques of distributed and parallel computing. Students will learn to design, implement, and analyze programs that run efficiently across multiple processors or networked systems. Topics include parallel algorithms, distributed systems, programming models (MPI, OpenMP), synchronization, communication, and performance optimization.
  </p>
  
  <p class=" leading-relaxed">
    By the end, you will be able to develop parallel and distributed applications, optimize performance, and address challenges like coordination and fault tolerance in real-world computing systems.
